# prevedel-yoon-matlab-light-field

This repository is primarily a clone of the Matlab code from "Simultaneous whole-animal 3D-imaging of neuronal activity using light field microscopy",
R. Prevedel, Y.-G. Yoon *et al.*, Nature Methods **11** 727â€“730 (2014). Reposted here with permission from Young-Gyu Yoon.

This repository incorporates a couple of small bug fixes I have made to the original code (including one affecting PSF generation (see file calcPSF.m). 
However, its main purpose is to demonstrate how my fast light field projection code can be called seamlessly from this existing Matlab codebase,
accelerating this too.
